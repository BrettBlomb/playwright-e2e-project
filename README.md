# Playwright E2E Automation — Daily Login Test

This repository contains a fully automated Playwright end-to-end test suite that validates the login functionality of a demo application.  
The workflow runs daily using GitHub Actions, generates a fresh video and GIF of the login flow, and updates this README automatically.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates:

- **Real end-to-end browser automation** using Playwright  
- **Daily scheduled test runs** through GitHub Actions  
- **Automatic video + GIF recording** of test execution  
- **Continuous documentation updates** by regenerating this README  
- **Artifact uploads** for debugging and transparency  
- **Headless cross-browser testing capability** (Chrome, Firefox, WebKit available)

It serves as a portfolio-ready example of modern QA automation practices, combining E2E testing, CI/CD pipelines, reporting, and auto-generated visual output.

## 🧪 What This Test Does

The daily Playwright job performs the following steps:

1. Launches a fresh browser instance  
2. Navigates to the demo login page  
3. Enters valid credentials  
4. Submits the login form  
5. Verifies successful navigation to the products page  
6. Records the entire flow as a video and GIF  
7. Updates this README with the latest timestamp and media  

This creates a living, continuously updated visualization of the test suite’s health.
